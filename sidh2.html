    <h1><b>FOOTBALL</b></h1>
    <p>Football is a fast-paced and dynamic sport played by two teams of 11 players, with the primary objective of scoring goals by getting the ball into the opponent's net. The game is played on a rectangular field, with each team defending one goal and trying to score in the other. Players use their feet, head, and body to control and pass the ball, while the goalkeeper is the only player allowed to use their hands within the penalty area. Football is played worldwide, from local parks to international tournaments, with major competitions like the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, and various domestic leagues. Known for its simplicity and global appeal, football unites people across cultures, transcending borders and languages, making it the worldâ€™s most popular sport.</p>
